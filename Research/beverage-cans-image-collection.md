# beverage-cans-image-collection

In preparation for the eventual Capture and Tag use case, Tictag launched a mini assignment that taggers could do in return for some coins. The task was for taggers to use their mobile phones to take images of beverage cans and submit them to us in return for coins. The were 2 goals of this mini assignment, the first was to see what kind of image quality we could expect to receive from taggers, and the second was to collect real user-submitted data to be used for the image-deduplication algorithm.

These were the instructions given out to the taggers: 

*Use your phone to take up to 50 images of beverage cans and submit them to us in exchange for in-app coins $$$ - each image is worth 12 coins!*

*The beverage can should occupy at least half of the image. Refer to the examples below.*

*We will accept multiple images of the same beverage can but they must be taken at different angles or distance.*

*Tictag has the right to accept or reject images, and we'll only award coins for images that are different enough.*

*You may submit this form multiple times but we'll only accept up to 50 images per user.*

Images collected can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1fvFnWwHKTXnj89eYtMz48WNK2jFTsQW2).

Findings from this mini assignment such as outputs from using different parameters of the image deduplication algorithm and be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1LaMSKogOA4NhlXyTb96vos_4fFs4TmZK).
