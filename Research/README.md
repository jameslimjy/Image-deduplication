# Research 
This folder contains the research that was done for the image-deduplicate use case. The flow of research was conducted in the same chronological order as the files listed below:

#### image-deduplicate-algorithm-walkthrough.py
This notebook goes through the entire image deduplication algorithm in great detail. Refer to this notebook to gain intuition as to what happens under the hood when /cluster_detector API is called in *Application* folder.

#### image-deduplicate-evaluation.py
The purpose of this notebook is to go through various clustering evaluation metrics that can be used to evaluate the results of the image-deduplication algorithm. 
Popular clustering evaluation metrics are discussed here.

#### algorithm-parameter-findings.md
This markdown file details the findings from using different parameters of the image-deduplication algorithm on the iPhone gallery images dataset. Different combinations of *hyperspace_distance_percentage* and *explained_var* were used and the findings were visually inspected and documented.

#### beverage-cans-image-collection.md
This markdown file contains information regarding a mini assignment sent out to taggers that served as a trial Capture and Tag assignment. It involves crowd sourcing image collection by utilizing taggers to use their mobile phones to take images of beverage cans in return for coins.
